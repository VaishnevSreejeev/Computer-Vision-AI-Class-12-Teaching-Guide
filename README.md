# Making Machines See: A Computer Vision Student Handbook

An interactive web-based guide for learning the basics of Computer Vision. This project was built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide Icons, designed to run directly in the browser without complex build steps.

## Features

*   **Interactive Modules**: Learn about Pixels, RGB, and Resolution interactively.
*   **The CV Pipeline**: A visual walkthrough of the 5 stages of Computer Vision.
*   **ML Visualizer**: Interactive K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-Means Clustering demos.
*   **Quiz**: Test your knowledge with a built-in quiz.
*   **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
    *   *Note: For the best experience, use a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server`) to avoid CORS issues with file uploads, though the app is designed to handle most things client-side.*

## Technologies Used
